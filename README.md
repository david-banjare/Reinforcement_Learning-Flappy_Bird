# Reinforcement_Learning-Flappy_Bird
A Reinforcement Learning project that implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play Flappy Bird, including environment setup, training logic, and visual gameplay using Pygame.


##**Overview-**
This midterm report outlines my learning and development progress on the project titled “Reinforcement Learning – Flappy Bird.” The goal of this project is to build a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent capable of learning to play the game Flappy Bird from scratch using Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

The project started with a refresher in core Python programming concepts, followed by a structured introduction to the foundational theory behind Reinforcement Learning. I implemented my first RL agent using DQN on the classic CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym, and then progressed to developing a fully custom RL-compatible Flappy Bird environment using Pygame.

All my work is organized and uploaded to a public GitHub repository, which includes the Python refresher notebook, CartPole DQN implementation, and the custom Flappy Bird environment.
